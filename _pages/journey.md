## 💼 Work Experience

### 🌾 Software Engineer — AgWeatherNet, Washington State University  
**Pullman, WA | February 2025 – Present**

As a Software Engineer at WSU AgWeatherNet, I develop cutting-edge agricultural technology solutions that enhance sustainable farming through data-driven insights. Key contributions include:

- Developed [AWN CropAI](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/awn-cropai/id6744830192), an iOS application that provides a 7-day Fruit Surface Temperature (FST) forecast, leveraging ML-based predictive models trained on weather data to support precision crop management.
- Enabled precise FST monitoring by implementing image segmentation techniques to isolate fruit regions in thermal images and adjusting for real-time atmospheric deviations to ensure accurate FST readings.
-	Developed [AWN CropAI-SWD](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/awn-cropai-swd/id6749020971), a cross-platform mobile application for detecting larvae in fruit samples that uses AI-powered image analysis trained on lab and field datasets to streamline the manual identification process.
- Developed a cross-platform mobile application for AgWeatherNet that provides real-time weather conditions, forecasts from AWN stations, and centralized access to applications developed by the AgWeatherNet team.
- Designed an Android application (Kotlin) leveraging wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to monitor greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂, NH₃, CH₄) and environmental factors on cattle farms.
- Developed a cross-platform mobile application for AgWeatherNet that provides real-time weather conditions, forecasts from AWN stations, and centralized access to applications developed by the AWN team.
- Bridging agricultural science and technology through mobile development, IoT integration, and ML-powered environmental monitoring.
