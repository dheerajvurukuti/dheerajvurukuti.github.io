## 💼 Work Experience

### 🌾 Natural Resource Scientist 2 — AgWeatherNet, Washington State University  
**Pullman, WA | February 2025 – Present**

As a Natural Resource Scientist 2 at AgWeatherNet, I develop cutting-edge agricultural technology solutions that enhance sustainable farming through data-driven insights. Key contributions include:

- Developed an iOS application (SwiftUI) that forecasts Fruit Surface Temperature (FST) using machine learning models, supporting optimal crop management.
- Integrated image segmentation to isolate fruit regions in thermal images, adjusting for real-time atmospheric deviations to ensure accurate FST readings.
- Designed an Android application (Kotlin) leveraging wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to monitor greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂, NH₃, CH₄) and environmental factors on cattle farms.
- Bridging agricultural science and technology through mobile development, IoT integration, and ML-powered environmental monitoring.
