I am a Natural Resource Scientist 2 at AgWeatherNet, where I develop innovative agricultural technology solutions to optimize farming practices using data-driven insights. Recently, I completed my Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from Washington State University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My expertise lies in building robust, scalable models and uncertainty-aware techniques to solve real-world challenges across cybersecurity, environmental monitoring, and agriculture.

Passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies, I thrive on bridging the gap between academic research and practical applications to deliver impactful results in dynamic environments.

I completed my Master‚Äôs thesis titled ‚ÄòUncertainty-Aware Machine Learning Techniques for Sustainable Malware Detection‚Äô at Washington State University. This research focused on integrating Gaussian Processes (GPs) to improve robustness in malware detection systems by quantifying uncertainty in predictions and enhancing decision-making under adversarial conditions.
