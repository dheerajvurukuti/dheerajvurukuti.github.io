I am a Natural Resource Scientist 2 at AgWeatherNet, where I develop innovative agricultural technology solutions to optimize farming practices using data-driven insights. Recently, I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Washington State University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My expertise lies in building robust, scalable models and uncertainty-aware techniques to solve real-world challenges across cybersecurity, environmental monitoring, and agriculture.

Passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies, I thrive on bridging the gap between academic research and practical applications to deliver impactful results in dynamic environments.
