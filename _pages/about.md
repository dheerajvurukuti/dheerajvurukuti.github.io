I‚Äôm a Software Engineer at Washington State University‚Äôs AgWeatherNet, where I develop AI-powered solutions for precision agriculture and environmental sustainability. My work focuses on transforming complex environmental and sensor data into actionable insights through mobile platforms and IoT-based systems. With a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from WSU and a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I bring a multidisciplinary approach to solving problems that span agricultural technology, environmental monitoring, and real-time decision support systems.

My journey began in cybersecurity research, where I investigated uncertainty-aware malware detection using Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), a fusion of neural networks and Gaussian processes. This work tackled real-world challenges like concept drift and class imbalance in evolving malware data, resulting in a 31% improvement in classification performance. Since then, I‚Äôve extended my focus to designing scalable, data-driven models across domains, mentoring students as a teaching assistant, and continually exploring how emerging technologies can drive positive impact. Whether it's solving complex data challenges, enhancing system intelligence, or designing user-focused technology, I am passionate about connecting cutting-edge research with real-world innovation.
