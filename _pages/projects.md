## üìö Academic Projects

### üîê Malware Detection
- Developed a proprietary **Transformer-based machine learning model** for malware analysis using **Smali codes** from the **Androzoo dataset**, efficiently processing large-scale Android application data.
- Achieved an **AUT (Area Under Time)** score of **0.92**, surpassing baseline methods and demonstrating high malware identification performance.
- Implemented **selective prediction** to enhance model reliability by issuing predictions only when confidence was sufficiently high, thereby reducing incorrect classifications.
- Incorporated **active learning strategies** to focus on the most uncertain samples, improving performance over time while minimizing the need for labeled data.
- Applied **conformal prediction** to provide statistically valid confidence intervals, ensuring robust **uncertainty quantification** for security-critical decision-making.
- Evaluated the model for **concept drift**, implementing retraining strategies to maintain accuracy over time as data distributions evolved.
