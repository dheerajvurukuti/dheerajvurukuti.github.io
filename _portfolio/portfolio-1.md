AWN CropAI, developed by our team at AgWeatherNet, is a cutting-edge smartphone application designed to assist growers in managing fruit sunburn risk and monitoring crop maturity. By connecting a thermal-RGB camera to the app, users can capture thermal images of fruit canopies and instantly assess fruit surface temperature (FST), identifying real-time heat stress levels. The app provides a 7-day FST forecast based on location-specific weather data from AgWeatherNet stations, allowing users to plan ahead for heat events using hourly projections. Built-in features like fruit diameter customization and wind speed overlays help fine-tune predictions for different orchard conditions.

In addition to heat stress monitoring, AWN CropAI performs color analysis to estimate the percentage of red, yellow, and green on each fruitâ€”supporting decisions around fruit maturity, quality, and netting removal. Its intuitive interface enables growers to select crops and cultivars, adjust weather inputs, and view detailed result screens showing sunburn risk severity and color distribution. The platform empowers growers to make data-driven, sustainable decisions that reduce crop loss, optimize water and energy use, and enhance fruit quality across the growing season.
