    My research introduces an innovative framework for uncertainty-aware malware detection, addressing the long-standing challenge of concept drift in cybersecurity. By integrating Gaussian Processes (GPs) into traditional machine learning pipelines, the framework enables the detection system to not only classify threats but also quantify its confidence in each prediction. This is particularly crucial in real-world deployments, where the cost of false positives and negatives can be high. Applied across two different mobile malware datasets—KRONODROID and TRANSCENDENT—our approach uses a Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) setup to balance scalability, accuracy, and interpretability.

    Through extensive experimentation and ablation studies, this GP-based framework demonstrated superior adaptability and accuracy, outperforming existing methods, and achieving a 31% improvement in AUT-F1 scores over state-of-the-art models. Notably, the system's ability to abstain from high-uncertainty decisions significantly reduced misclassifications, making it highly reliable for deployment in evolving threat landscapes. Detailed performance metrics and visual analyses underscored the robustness of the approach, offering deep insights into malware behavior and model reliability over time. This work lays the groundwork for building scalable, trustworthy, and long-term sustainable malware detection systems, with future extensions into real-time adaptation, adversarial robustness, and explainable AI for broader cybersecurity applications.
