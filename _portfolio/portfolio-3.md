AWN CropAI-SWD is an advanced AI-powered image analysis tool designed to help researchers, extension specialists, and growers detect Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD) larvae in berry and stone fruit samples. Built on extensive laboratory and field datasets, the app streamlines the traditionally slow and subjective process of manual larvae classification, offering a faster, more consistent, and more reliable solution. By transforming a time-intensive task into an efficient digital workflow, AWN CropAI-SWD empowers users to make quicker, data-driven decisions about pest management and crop health.

The app allows users to capture photos of berry samples directly through their device’s camera or upload existing images from their gallery. Once an image is selected, AWN CropAI-SWD automatically analyzes it using advanced AI models to detect SWD larvae with high precision. At present, the detection supports both 2nd instar larvae (3.5–5 mm) and 3rd instar larvae (>5 mm), with ongoing development to expand coverage to additional stages and pest species. Detected larvae are highlighted with clear bounding boxes red for 3rd instar and green for 2nd instar making it easy to visually verify and interpret the results.

In addition to real-time detection, AWN CropAI-SWD includes a built-in history section, enabling users to save, review, and compare their past analyses. This feature is especially useful for long-term monitoring and research projects, allowing for consistent tracking and data validation over time. The app also supports exporting detection data for sharing, reporting, and integrating into larger research efforts or pest management systems, making it a versatile tool for individual growers, research teams, and extension programs alike.

By automating the most tedious and error prone aspects of larvae detection, AWN CropAI-SWD saves time, reduces subjectivity, and increases the accuracy of pest identification. Whether in the field or in the lab, the app delivers a practical, portable, and scalable solution that bridges the gap between technology and agriculture. Future updates will introduce additional pest species, expanded larvae stage recognition, and enhanced reporting capabilities to further support data-driven decisions and sustainable pest management strategies.
